				"Awake"
- Dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations
  that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep.
  However, some people say that dreams are manifestations of one's deepest desires
  and anxieties, often relating to repressed childhood memories or obsessions.
